### Who am I?
I'm Diego Acosta, I'm based in Monterrey, Mexico and I am a dedicated researcher and computer scientist currently immersed in the world of Artificial Intelligence. I'm currently balancing my time between personal exciting projects and working as a Data Science Project Specialist at Tec de Monterrey.

My primary passion lies in DNN and the power they hold in extracting invaluable insights from data through the magic of AI. Specifically, I've been focusing on the exciting field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), where I'm exploring the endless possibilities AI offers to understand and manipulate human language.

However, my enthusiasm for AI and Computer Science extends far beyond my current specialization. I'm always on the lookout for collaboration opportunities with fellow enthusiasts who share a keen interest in these fields. My approach to problem-solving is fueled by creativity, as I firmly believe that groundbreaking ideas often emerge at the crossroads of diverse domains.

Feel free to connect with me via email at diegoacosta099@gmail.com. I'm eager to engage with like-minded people, exchange knowledge, and embark on innovative collaboration in the world of AI and Computer Science.
